# Snappyflow

SnappyFlow is one of my previous employer's (Xorinat) project. Since it is a compnay owned project, I dont have access to codebase.

It provides the follwing features:

* Comprehensive analysis of distributed microservices applications across VMs, Containers and Cloud Services
* Strong correlation across different elements of the stack

* Integrated workflow, including, Metrics, Log Management, Distributed Tracing, Synthetic Monitoring and Alert Management
